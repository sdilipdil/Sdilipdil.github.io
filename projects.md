          The goal of the competition was to design and prototype an app that supports the collection and communication of health care data (clinical, consumer and environmental) to enable better-informed clinical decisions, more personalized care, and improve and benefit healthcare services in the country,Using Philips HealthSuite Digital Platform(HSDP), thus my team used an Internet Of Things based solution and won hackathon.

          The idea is to convert a relatively subjective, skill intensive, training intensive behavioral hearing screening for newborns and infants to a simple, objective, reliable and easy to use technology that can empower health workers to perform effective behavioral hearing screening in resource constrained settings in India. The idea/technology involves a digital and medical electronics application where motion sensors and IR sensors (imbedded in a blanket and cap with an eye piece) accurately assess the baby's eye and body movements within 2 seconds of response to a sound stimulus and communicate this objective information to a software application that will be installed in mobile phone/tablet which will ensure adherence to the standard steps and analysis of the babies responses to provide an objective red or green response (Deaf/No Deaf) to the health worker using this app. If the baby passes the test then the health worker follows up at 3.5 months, 6, 9 and 12 months. If the baby fails this test then the health worker refers the child to the closest center that performs a gold standard screening test called OAE. (Oto-Acoustic Emissions) If the child fails that as well then an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) is carried out. Based on the overall results a cochlear implantation or brain stem auditory implantation or standard hearing aids may be indicated to treat the hearing loss at the earliest.
We won this hackathon under GE Healthcare India Awards.

           We developed a wearable device that allows people to match their posture and track,monitor your movements in real time, critique them, and give advice on to improve your workout.
We are trying to solve two major problems faced by People working out.
a. The biggest issues faced during workout is getting injured. The injury rate is 21% .Everyday in US approximately 10,000 people get admitted to emergencies due to workout injuries.
b. People want to get best results for limited time they spend on workout in midst of their busy life.

Our wearable device utilizes motion sensors to match user's postures with predefined proper postures .The devices provides hap-tic feedback to engage the user to help push for perfection.The devices tracks various parameters involved with the user motion which get stored in the cloud to help analyze and improve the workout for better results with the help of an app.

          High expenditure on maintenance, huge loss of capital due to frequent factory shutdown and no way to keep track on the work done by the employees so we came up with an solution to track the health of machines with the help of Current Sensor, Accelerometer sensor and temperature sensor to continue monitoring the data, data uploaded on cloud which can be accessed from anywhere thus the basic analysis can be done.

         The developed wearable can be used by a normal parents, the baby monitor helps pacify the parents by allowing them to check in on their sleeping baby without having to enter the room. But wearable uses its machine-learning technology to send parents a push notification when they cannot pay full attention, such as in the shower or when taking a nap. It pairs a wearable band with a mobile app to deliver the results of measurements in real time such as:
•	Predicting when the baby will wake up
•	If the baby rolled over
•	The baby’s mood when he or she wakes up
•	The room temperature
•	Baby sleep patterns
