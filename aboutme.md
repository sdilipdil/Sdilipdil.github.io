<p>My aim is to identify a problem out of many and solve it using a multidimensional approach. Strong believer, Self-taught developer, I believe knowledge is something which you earn. Thus every day is a lesson for me, even I think creativity is the result of the constraints one works around. Most important part of problem solving is knowing the constraints around which one has to work and find a solution. Passionate about electronics , 'Making'. Interested in Embedded system, Internet Of Things, Spintronics, Marketing and Client relations.</p>
