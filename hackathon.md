          The goal of the competition was to design and prototype an app that supports the collection and communication of health care data (clinical, consumer and environmental) to enable better-informed clinical decisions, more personalized care, and improve and benefit healthcare services in the country,Using Philips HealthSuite Digital Platform(HSDP), thus my team used an Internet Of Things based solution and won hackathon.

          The idea is to convert a relatively subjective, skill intensive, training intensive behavioral hearing screening for newborns and infants to a simple, objective, reliable and easy to use technology that can empower health workers to perform effective behavioral hearing screening in resource constrained settings in India. The idea/technology involves a digital and medical electronics application where motion sensors and IR sensors (imbedded in a blanket and cap with an eye piece) accurately assess the baby's eye and body movements within 2 seconds of response to a sound stimulus and communicate this objective information to a software application that will be installed in mobile phone/tablet which will ensure adherence to the standard steps and analysis of the babies responses to provide an objective red or green response (Deaf/No Deaf) to the health worker using this app. If the baby passes the test then the health worker follows up at 3.5 months, 6, 9 and 12 months. If the baby fails this test then the health worker refers the child to the closest center that performs a gold standard screening test called OAE. (Oto-Acoustic Emissions) If the child fails that as well then an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) is carried out. Based on the overall results a cochlear implantation or brain stem auditory implantation or standard hearing aids may be indicated to treat the hearing loss at the earliest.
We won this hackathon under GE Healthcare India Awards.
